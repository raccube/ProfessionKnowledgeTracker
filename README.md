# Profession Knowledge Tracker

![World of Warcraft version 12.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/WoW-12.0.0-purple)

Adds a "Knowledge Sources" tab to the Profession window for tracking one-off and repeatable profession knowledge sources.

Based on [Myu's Knowledge Points Tracker](https://wago.io/L7lpDrqUO) (WeakAura)

Currently only up to date for TWW as I don't have Beta access.
